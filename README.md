### Finance Manager
##### By [Aashish Koirala](http://aashishkoirala.github.io)

This is a tool I built to keep track of my personal finances. It lets you create a period budget, and lets you record your transactions so that you can track it against the budget.

For more information, please visit the GitHub page for this repository at [aashishkoirala.github.io/financemanager](http://aashishkoirala.github.io/financemanager).

This version consists of the following features:

+ View and enter transactions on the Transactions tab

The following enhancements, soon to follow:
